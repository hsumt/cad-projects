Chained with a #25 94Link Chain chained 12:60 driven by two Kraken X60 with each 20:1 reductions, this Dead Axle pivot is more a proof-of-concept. More effort was put into precise **POCKETING** of the plates involved and making sure I was able to create clean and polished CAD (including fasteners, which are VERY time consuming to add in)

7/8" Diameter shaft was selected because based on stress tests. Although quite exaggerated, you can see there's a considerable load on it, but the main advantage is its footprint.

For example, quite clearly a 2" Tube will have a truckload more strength against a similar load, however its size footprint is just too large to be a good use of limited space on the robot and the pivot.

7/8" was selected here, but the SplineXL/MAXSplines are ALSO very popular alternatives

Anyway, there's a pretty clean CAD tolerancing as far as shafts, spacers, and fits on this mechanism.

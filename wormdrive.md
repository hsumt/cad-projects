This project was a personal exploration of mechanical power transmission methods, specifically using a worm gear to achieve a high torque/low speed output on the simple scale. This is a good example of the extreme side or the torque vs. speed tradeoffs. I did learn that worm gears are quite generally used in winches, lifts, and rotary mechanisms. It's also possible that it would be used in a nice handcrank, which is actually an idea that did pop into my head while modeling it.

I modeled the core components of the worm drive (Worm, worm wheel, shaft support, and simplified bearing) and assembled them in CAD with realistic clearances and tolerances.

While the design did in fact work in principle, and did in fact achieve correct motion with the proper gear realtions, I ran into a decent amount of issues making the system fully parametric and configurable. Rebuilding the worm teeth to regenerate when key deimsnions changed caused geometry errors in the part studio. Having understood the key usages and benefits of the worm gear, I decided to pivot, not because I was quitting but it was also a lesson for me.

- I'm a pretty completionist/perfectionist type of person, so it's very hard for me to turn away from projects that aren't working how I really want, even though I got the main lessons out of it already.
- The main two benefits I can identify from this project at the current time are:
1. Learn how a worm drive works and be able to CAD it
2. Understand the usages of worm drive plus how to configure part studios


I actually learned more about configurations in my MK4i Base Generator, a project which I am very proud of, because it taught me all about linking up configurations and the importance of having different options to select from, while being able to change variables very easily without breaking the entire CAD

But, as mentioned previously, I had to practice the mindset of falling forward more often, making sure its OK to say "I learned the main concepts and what I needed to gain from this, I know how to model worm gears now", over trying to make something perfect, that I'm sure other people online have probably made much better versions of.

If I revisit worm gears, I will definitely be integrating it specifically into a project, but for now, I consider this CAD to be a successful proof-of-concept with pretty cool takeaways I can bring into my upcoming mechanical projects

A set of smaller backwheels rotates in reverse to apply counter-spin, reducing excess backspin and improving shot accuracy and trajectory. A ramp guides power cells into the main flywheel, with a feeder wheel regulating intake and spacing.

Additionally, the main flywheel is sized and positioned to handle multiple power cells without significant RPM drop. This is achieved by designing for a higher moment of inertia, helping the flywheel maintain speed even when multiple balls pass through in quick succession.
A lot of the game actually relied on being able to maintain that RPM as you fired multiple balls (up to 6) in quick succession into the goal.

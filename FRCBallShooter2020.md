A set of smaller backwheels rotates in reverse to apply counter-spin, reducing excess backspin and improving shot accuracy and trajectory. A ramp guides power cells into the main flywheel, with a feeder wheel regulating intake and spacing.

Additionally, the main flywheel is sized and positioned to handle multiple power cells without significant RPM drop. This is achieved by designing for a higher moment of inertia, helping the flywheel maintain speed even when multiple balls pass through in quick succession.
A lot of the game actually relied on being able to maintain that RPM as you fired multiple balls (up to 6) in quick succession into the goal.

The ball shooter itself was developed as a complete and functional mechanism, designed fully with the intent of the FRC (First Robotics Competition) game Infinite Recharge. It's a pretty high-speed flywheel that launches power cells, 7 inch diameter balls, with a feeder wheel for consistent loading into the shooter.

This is one of my first practice mechanisms and functionally sound subsystem designs, pretty much a good visualization for how to Master Sketch, and Layout more of my projects, which is reflected in most of my CAD projects now, where I will *always* attempt to model a Layout of the power transmission and main pathing before I CAD anything.

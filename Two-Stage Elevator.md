Power Transmission in this project was an easy choice. After seeing the effects of the belt and pulley combo skipping on the 2025 NOMAD Competition Robot, well Chain/Sprocket was an obvious choice.
Also, used the TTB bearing blocks and Dyneema Cable - dyneema being ultra-light polyethylene fibers that can be up to 15x stronger than steel, and because its low stretch, its perfect for rigging 2/3 stage elevators

It was designed in a cascade configuration, because its faster and also synchronized stage movement, which also just looks aesthetically more pleasing.

It was also a nice pocketing exercise for me, but was also a good way to put my CAD skills to the test with an elevator, which had never designed more than a single stage elevator before.

The idea was based upon how it was frustrating to make a Drivebase over and over for different FRC Robots. However, I decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to create a Generator that works just upon import. 

I did not add a bellypan as bellypan variations can vary depending on what the robot needs, depending on electronic or hole setup, so I find it to be more favourable to create the bellypan/brainpan *in* the actual robot document.
May come back to this when the MK5n releases but I found it fun to learn how configs work in Onshape
